### Debug 🐛

Show reference counting of an object in debug console to debug memory leaks.
```
print(CFGetRetainCount(object))
```

### Deeplinks 🔗
Easily test deeplink on simulator from CLI

```sh
xcrun simctl openurl booted "{DEEPLINK}"
```

Example:
```sh
xcrun simctl openurl booted "my_app://path/to/view"
```

### Push Notifications 📬

Trigger remote push notification from curl request to test your application.

```sh
curl -v \
-d '{"aps":{"alert":"test","sound":"default"}}' \
-H "apns-topic:$BUNDLE" \
-H "apns-expiration: 1" \
-H "apns-priority: 10" \
--http2 \
--cert $PATH_TO_PEM_FILE:$PASSPHRASE \
https://api.development.push.apple.com/3/device/$DEVICE_TOKEN
```
* `$BUNDLE` to replace with your bundle app
* `$PATH_TO_PEM_FILE` to replace with path to your pem file
* `$PASSPHRASE` to replace with your passphrase used with your pem file
* `$DEVICE_TOKEN` to replace with the device token you want to target

Note that you can replace `https://api.development.push.apple.com` with `https://api.push.apple.com` for production test.

Example:

__Default notification__

```sh
curl -v \
-d '{"aps":{"alert":"test","sound":"default"}}' \
-H "apns-topic:com.yourcompanyname.yourappname" \
-H "apns-expiration: 1" \
-H "apns-priority: 10" \
--http2 \
--cert certfile.pem:1234 \
https://api.development.push.apple.com/3/device/123456789
```

__Silent notification__

```sh
curl -v \
-d '{"aps":{"content-available":1}, "key":"value"}' \
-H "apns-topic:com.yourcompanyname.yourappname" \
-H "apns-expiration: 1" \
-H "apns-priority: 10" \
--http2 \
--cert certfile.pem:1234 \
https://api.development.push.apple.com/3/device/123456789
```

### Url Redirection 🔀

Resolve url redirection to test destination for universal link

```
curl -s -I -L -o /dev/null -w %{url_effective} URL_TO_TEST
```
* `-s` for silent mode
* `-I` for head of request only
* `-L` to follow redirection
* `-o FILE` to write output to `/dev/null`
* `-w FORMAT` to use output format after completion

Example:
```
curl -s -I -L -o /dev/null -w %{url_effective} https://maps.google.com
# return https://www.google.com/maps
```
